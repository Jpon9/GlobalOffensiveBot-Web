## GlobalOffensiveBot-Web

This is the webpanel for the /r/GlobalOffensive utility bot.  It's written in
the Laravel PHP framework utilizing MySQL and Mongo databases for authentication
and data storage respectively.

To configure the project, it is recommended that you install Laravel first
(perhaps by using [LaravelDeployment]((https://github.com/Jpon9/LaravelDeployment))) if it suits your fancy) and pack up this
repository's files as a `.tar` and extract them into the Laravel installation.
This would ensure your application has a proper app key set and the development
files and programs installed -- which is handy!  The files you need to configure
specifically are `.env` and `config/database.php`, each of which have example
counterparts as a part of this repository.
